You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.

```
Example:
Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.

# 分析
没有简单的办法，三层循环。需要注意的就是根据三个点来求解三角形面积，系鞋带法

# 代码
空间复杂度O(1),时间复杂度O(N3)
