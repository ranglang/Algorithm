You are given an array A of strings.

Two strings S and T are special-equivalent if after any number of moves, S == T.

A move consists of choosing two indices i and j with i % 2 == j % 2, and swapping S[i] with S[j].

Now, a group of special-equivalent strings from A is a non-empty subset S of A such that any string not in S is not special-equivalent with any string in S.

Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from A.

```
Input: ["a","b","c","a","c","c"]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 groups ["a","a"], ["b"], ["c","c","c"]

Input: ["aa","bb","ab","ba"]
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 groups ["aa"], ["bb"], ["ab"], ["ba"]

Input: ["abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 groups ["abc","cba"], ["acb","bca"], ["bac","cab"]

Input: ["abcd","cdab","adcb","cbad"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 group ["abcd","cdab","adcb","cbad"]
```
