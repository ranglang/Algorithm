We define a harmonious array is an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

```
Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
```

空间复杂度O(N),时间复杂度O(N)
```Python
class Solution:
    def findLHS(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        from collections import Counter
        nums_counter = Counter(nums)
        max_len = 0
        for key in nums_counter:
            if (key+1) in nums_counter:
                max_len = max(max_len,nums_counter[key] + nums_counter[key+1])
        return max_len
