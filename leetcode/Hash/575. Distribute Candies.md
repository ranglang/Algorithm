# 分析
水题，通过set可解决。在能够使用set的情况下，就使用set，而不用map


# 代码
空间复杂度O(n),时间复杂度O(n)
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int distributeCandies(vector<int>& candies) {
        int len = candies.size();
        unordered_set<int> s;
        for(auto candy : candies){
            s.insert(candy);
        }
        int half = len/2;
        return min(half,int(s.size()));
    }
};
```
